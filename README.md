# OG-Steam-Library

+*Update 2, 31/03/2022*+

<a href=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/3/3180111663688488908/>Turns out the latest Steam beta has broken all popup windows. We'll just have to wait for an update.</a>

+*Update, 31/03/2022*+

On 28/03/2022, an update to Steam caused SteamFriendsPatcher to stop working. It was discovered that this was caused by changes to CSS filenames. Luckily the problem can be fixed easily. You will need to open Settings in SteamFriendsPatcher, then change "Library CSS" from "0.css" to "7.css". There is a forum thread on the OG Skin 2004 Steam Commmunity page, which can be found here <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/og-skin/discussions/1/3187992943275121931/">here.</a>

Library theme for use with <a href="https://github.com/ungstein/OG-Steam">OG-Steam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP">SFP<a> (Previously <a href="https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SteamFriendsPatcher">SteamFriendsPatcher</a>). A lot of unnecessary padding as been removed to free up screen real estate. Transitions and gradients have also been removed.

Update: Live version now available <a href="https://ungstein.github.io/og-steam-library/og-steam-library-live.zip">here!</a>
This version loads up-to-date files live from GitHub; no files are saved to your computer. If the live version does not appear to be updating, please try deleting Steam's browser cache under `Settings/Web Browser`, then restart Steam.

Installing
-

* Make sure SFP_UI.exe is running.
* Copy the **steamui** folder into your Steam installation folder (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam").
* Optional webkit.css can be placed in skins\OG-Steam\resource to remove additional fluff such as What's New, Ratings, Add to Activity Feed and Trading Cards.

Uninstalling
-

* Exit SFP. Make sure SFP is not set to run on startup (Settings > uncheck "Start with Windows")
* Delete the **steamui** folder, then restart Steam. This will force Steam to download and extract the current Steam package, giving you the original Library files.
