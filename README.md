# OG-Steam-Library

+*Update 3, 29/05/2025*+

After several years of inactivity, I have decided to suspend this project indefinitely. Part of me was hoping that Valve would either officially support skins, or stop messing with classes, neither of which have happened.
I would like to thank <a href=https://github.com/MapleAtMorning/>Maple</a> for creating <a href=https://github.com/MapleAtMorning/OldSteam-Theme/>OldSteam-Theme</a>, which I consider to be the spiritual successor to both <a href="https://github.com/ungstein/OG-Steam">OG-Steam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ungstein/OG-Steam-Library">OG-Steam-Library</a>. Unfortunately, it appears that this project has also been indefinitely suspended, due to study commitments. It has been a fun journey, seeing this old green skin live on for much longer than Valve had planned. Maybe once SteamOS takes over the world, we will once again have custom skins. Until then, green Steam will live on in our memories.
Thank you to those who used my skins, I hope you got kick out of them.

<a href=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/3/3180111663688488908/>Turns out the latest Steam beta has broken all popup windows. We'll just have to wait for an update.</a>

+*Update, 31/03/2022*+

On 28/03/2022, an update to Steam caused SteamFriendsPatcher to stop working. It was discovered that this was caused by changes to CSS filenames. Luckily the problem can be fixed easily. You will need to open Settings in SteamFriendsPatcher, then change "Library CSS" from "0.css" to "7.css". There is a forum thread on the OG Skin 2004 Steam Commmunity page, which can be found here <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/og-skin/discussions/1/3187992943275121931/">here.</a>

Library theme for use with <a href="https://github.com/ungstein/OG-Steam">OG-Steam</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP">SFP</a> (Previously <a href="https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SteamFriendsPatcher">SteamFriendsPatcher<a>). A lot of unnecessary padding as been removed to free up screen real estate. Transitions and gradients have also been removed.

Update: Live version now available <a href="https://ungstein.github.io/og-steam-library/og-steam-library-live.zip">here!</a>
This version loads up-to-date files live from GitHub; no files are saved to your computer. If the live version does not appear to be updating, please try deleting Steam's browser cache under `Settings/Web Browser`, then restart Steam.

Installing
-

* Make sure SteamFriendsPatcher.exe is running.
* Make sure Steam Beta is checked in SteamFriendsPatcher Settings.
* Copy the **steamui** folder into your Steam installation folder (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam").
* Optional webkit.css can be placed in skins\OG-Steam\resource to remove additional fluff such as What's New, Ratings, Add to Activity Feed and Trading Cards.

Uninstalling
-

* Exit SteamFriendsPatcher. Make sure SteamFriendsPatcher is not set to run on startup (Settings > uncheck "Start with Windows")
* Delete the **steamui** folder, then restart Steam. This will force Steam to download and extract the current Steam package, giving you the original Library files.
